  ###### [Pokedex | Live Site](http://pokedex.zach.coffee)

**The goal: capture all 151 original Pokemon by drawing them!**

The list of 151 original pokemon are rendered from the fan-maintained Pokemon API. As I complete illustrations for each Pokemon, a page is added to the site. Pokemon info is pulled from the API.

The site is built using Gatsby, which is a framework for quickly creating fast, dynamic web applications built on React and GraphQL. I'm using it in this project as a static site generator. When new Pokemon pages are added, the site is re-built and pre-rendered into static HTML. API calls are only made when the site re-builds.
